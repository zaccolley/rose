		<p>Last week we went to <a href="http://theweb.is">The Web Is</a>, a web conference celebrating 25 years of the WWW.</p>

<p>The event is hosted in Cardiff, so Peter and I took the train from Fratton. A 3+ hour journey but no changes so it&rsquo;s not bad. We met <a href="http://twitter.com/nickcolley">my brother, Nick</a> there. <img class="emoji" title="'station' emoji" alt="'station' emoji" src="/img/emojione-emoji/svg/station.svg" ></p>

<h2>Day 0 <small>Wednesday</small></h2>

<p>We arrived and checked in to our hotel. <img class="emoji" title="'hotel' emoji" alt="'hotel' emoji" src="/img/emojione-emoji/svg/hotel.svg" > There was a pre-conf meet up at the <a href="http://foundershub.co.uk/">Founder&rsquo;s Hub</a> for some tabletop games. That was cool, a few web people huddled to play <em>Snake Oil</em> which was similar to <em>Cards Against Humanity</em> but less horrible. After that we walked over to a local pub called the <a href="http://www.urbantaphouse.co.uk/">Urban Tap House</a>. <img class="emoji" title="'beers' emoji" alt="'beers' emoji" src="/img/emojione-emoji/svg/beers.svg" ></p>

<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s a place for craft beer nerds. We don&rsquo;t know a lot about beers so the barkeep ended up pouring shots of different ones while we pretended we could tell difference between them. Then we chilled with <a href="https://twitter.com/FrankJWest">some more</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/drublic">cool</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/helloanselm">cats</a> there. <img class="emoji" title="'smile_cat' emoji" alt="'smile_cat' emoji" src="/img/emojione-emoji/svg/smile_cat.svg" ></p>

<h2>Day 1 <small>Thursday</small></h2>

<p>All the talks were themed by the name of the conference. The web is&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>&rsquo;&hellip; knowledge&rsquo; <cite>Chris Murphy <a href="https://twitter.com/fehler">@fehler</a></cite></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>My twin brother and I are both doing web jobs. <img class="emoji" title="'sunglasses' emoji" alt="'sunglasses' emoji" src="/img/emojione-emoji/svg/sunglasses.svg" ></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is I went to Uni to study whereas he started an apprenticeship at a local company. I&rsquo;m glad I came to University, and I&rsquo;ve tried to make the most of the opportunities but I don&rsquo;t think the degree is worth anything on paper.</p>

<p>Chris touched on this and stressed the importance of encouraging people to believe in themselves. He also reaffirmed the very slow pace of the Uni curriculum, often being 5+ years behind industry, yeah&hellip; <img class="emoji" title="'older_man' emoji" alt="'older_man' emoji" src="/img/emojione-emoji/svg/older_man.svg" ></p>

<blockquote>
<h3>&rsquo;&hellip; everywhere&rsquo; <cite>Anna Debenham <a href="https://twitter.com/anna_debenham">@anna_debenham</a></cite></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>Really enjoyed this talk, Anna talked about game console browsers. I think the main question was: Who uses these devices to browse anyway? </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a surprising amount and we shouldn&rsquo;t discount a browser or device just because we don&rsquo;t use it. Should always consider the target audience for a product.</p>

<p>&hellip; Annnnd this is a good excuse to get some more consoles in the office. <img class="emoji" title="'wink' emoji" alt="'wink' emoji" src="/img/emojione-emoji/svg/wink.svg" ></p>

<p>Anna has <a href="http://console.maban.co.uk/">a game console browsers site</a> with her findings if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>&rsquo;&hellip; in the hands of the 97ers&rsquo; <cite>Emma Mulqueeny <a href="https://twitter.com/hubmum">@hubmum</a></cite></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;97ers&rdquo; are people born in 1997 and have always had social media in their lives.</p>

<p>Emma talked about how Instagram, Twitter and <del>Facebook</del> Snapchat etc. are a key part of their identities and should be taken into consideration when designing and building services in the future. <img class="emoji" title="'alien' emoji" alt="'alien' emoji" src="/img/emojione-emoji/svg/alien.svg" ></p>

<p>She talked about how they&rsquo;re discussing bringing voting processes online to encourage them to vote.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>&rsquo;&hellip; a discussion&rsquo; <cite>Andy Clarke <a href="https://twitter.com/Malarkey/">@Malarkey</a> with guests</cite></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>Mental health is something that’s affected both Peter and I.</p>

<p>Andy invited Chris Murphy (who spoke the day before), <a href="http://twitter.com/cole007">Cole Henley</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/rellyab">Relly Annett-Baker</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/Clare_Symons">Dr. Clare Symons</a> to chat about mental health, in and around the industry.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to see it’s being talked about but Clare noted that it isn’t a industry specific problem. It’s everywhere. 1 in 4 in the UK will experience a mental health issue each year.</p>

<p>She did point out that we can spend a lot of time in isolation so that is a potential problem.</p>

<p>Talking is often easier with people you feel you can relate to, so I think it&rsquo;s important that we have issues like this being discussed in groups we&rsquo;re already apart of.</p>

<h3>Evening</h3>

<p>We went to a place called <a href="http://www.thelivelounge.com/">the Live Lounge</a> for a bit of an after party.</p>

<p>Ended up hanging out with some <a href="http://hackbmth.org/">hackbmth</a> &amp; <a href="http://hacksoton.com/">hacksoton</a> people talking about <a href="http://hackpompey.co.uk">hackpompey</a> and the future of the south tech scene&hellip;</p>

<p>Legit web stuff of course. <img class="emoji" title="'sweat_smile' emoji" alt="'sweat_smile' emoji" src="/img/emojione-emoji/svg/sweat_smile.svg" ></p>

<h2>Day 2 <small>Friday</small></h2>

<p>Friday was Halloween so <a href="https://twitter.com/rosedgtl/status/528116366184701952">I customised my lanyard</a> for extra spooks. <img class="emoji" title="'jack_o_lantern' emoji" alt="'jack_o_lantern' emoji" src="/img/emojione-emoji/svg/jack_o_lantern.svg" > <img class="emoji" title="'ghost' emoji" alt="'ghost' emoji" src="/img/emojione-emoji/svg/ghost.svg" > These were designed by Portsmouth regular <a href="https://twitter.com/de">Dan Edwards</a> which is cool to see!</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>&rsquo;&hellip; like water&rsquo; <cite>Scott Jenson <a href="https://twitter.com/scottjenson">@scottjenson</a></cite></h3>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/zaccolley/status/528126932567592962"><img class="img-right" src="/assets/physicalwebdevice.jpg" alt="The experimental Physical Web device"></a></p>

<p>One of the problems with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/">iBeacons</a> is you need to download an app for every single place they&rsquo;re used. Scott talked about a solution, under <a href="https://google.github.io/physical-web/">the &ldquo;Physical Web&rdquo;</a>, using the web instead of apps.</p>

<p>He gave out small experimental devices that send out URLs via low-power Bluetooth. The idea being the URL can do many things from as simple as taking you to a website or it could be linked to payment (using PayPal or Stripe possibly).</p>

<p><a href="http://etchuk.tumblr.com/post/101669101040/lets-get-physical">Adam over at Etch wrote some good stuff</a> on this if you want to know more.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>&rsquo;&hellip; a great big playground&rsquo; <cite>Seb Lee-Delisle <a href="https://twitter.com/seb_ly">@seb_ly</a></cite></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>Lazers were the main point of Seb&rsquo;s talk&hellip; I think. <img class="emoji" title="'rotating_light' emoji" alt="'rotating_light' emoji" src="/img/emojione-emoji/svg/rotating_light.svg" ></p>

<p>He also makes art seem accessible to coders, which is cool because most people tell themselves they&rsquo;re not creative. He reminded me of the work that <a href="https://twitter.com/whichlight">Kawandeep Virdee</a> has been doing in America.</p>

<p>Gave me a good dose of inspiration to actually finish some of my pet projects.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>&rsquo;&hellip; still young&rsquo; <cite>Benjamin Hollway <a href="https://twitter.com/benjaminhollway">@benjaminhollway</a></cite></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t have known it was Ben&rsquo;s first talk.</p>

<p>One topic he spoke about the young people in our industry and how a lot of events aren&rsquo;t tailored to under 18s. After parties are in pubs and bars that they can&rsquo;t access and the only. <img class="emoji" title="'underage' emoji" alt="'underage' emoji" src="/img/emojione-emoji/svg/underage.svg" ></p>

<p>He wrote <a href="http://nothingrandom.com/thinks/sorry-not-old-enough">a blog post</a> on this which you should read. Tech is a pretty toxic place at the moment but we&rsquo;re seeing more talk, events and movements towards making it more inclusive and welcoming.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>&rsquo;&hellip; turning difficulties into opportunities&rsquo; <cite>Robin Christopherson <a href="https://twitter.com/USA2DAY">@USA2DAY</a></cite></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>Last time I saw Robin talk was at <a href="http://altitude.io/">Altitude in Portsmouth</a>, he always gives a great perspective and reinforces thinking about accessibility from the start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;TAB&quot;s (Temporarily Able-Bodied <img class="emoji" title="'smile' emoji" alt="'smile' emoji" src="/img/emojione-emoji/svg/smile.svg" >), need to take this more seriously. It increases usability to everyone not just those with disabilities.</p>

<p>As a blind person, he talked about how tech such as applications that can detect objects via the camera can help immensely for day-to-day tasks. </p>

<blockquote>
<h3>&rsquo;&hellip; taking itself far too seriously&rsquo; <cite>Mr Bingo <a href="https://twitter.com/Mr_Bingo">@Mr_Bingo</a></cite></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>I think maybe Mr Bingo&rsquo;s talk was one of my favourites.</p>

<p>He talked about his work and just swore a lot really. This is how Mr Bingo sees the Internet:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SequenceAgency/status/528256495319015424"><img src="/assets/mrbingo.jpg" alt="Mr Bingo at The web is..."></a>
<em>Picture via <a href="https://twitter.com/SequenceAgency/status/528256495319015424">@SequenceAgency</a></em></p>

<p>He has this great project called <a href="http://www.mr-bingo.org.uk/index.php?/root/hate-mail/">&lsquo;Hate Mail&rsquo;</a>, where people pay him to send them horrible postcards. <img class="emoji" title="'postbox' emoji" alt="'postbox' emoji" src="/img/emojione-emoji/svg/postbox.svg" ></p>

<hr>

<p>For us this conference (and events like these in general) was all about the people, we met some really interesting and cool people. Look forward to the next one. <img class="emoji" title="'blush' emoji" alt="'blush' emoji" src="/img/emojione-emoji/svg/blush.svg" ></p>
