At ROSE we want to encourage diversity in the tech community, so where better to start than at school? It's a great place to inspire and get children involved in tech at an early age. :boy: :girl:

We decided to get involved with Code Club after Zac's brother [Nick](http://twitter.com/nickcolley), who helps run a West Midlands club, recommended it to us.

## What is Code Club?

[Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) is a series of after school clubs ran by volunteers, with the aim to teach children about programming. :computer: They're run every week and split into terms. The terms cover projects including games, websites, electronics and more... 

They supply the learning materials, _generally_ all you have to do is turn up and help the students through it.

## Back to School

Signing up as a volunteer on the website was easy and there were lots of local schools who were excited. We got talking to [Wimborne Junior School](http://www.wimborne-jun.portsmouth.sch.uk/) in Southsea.

We were greeted by David :man:, a teacher at the school, we got an overwhelming sense of nostalgia. He went over the current IT curriculum,  the students at the school are taught basic programming including Scratch. We think this is great, it's a lot better than when we were at school.

Stepping foot in a primary school was pretty weird for me, as I haven't been inside a primary school now for 14 years or so. The first thing that jumped out for us was just how low down everything was.

We'll be starting in September and we can't wait. :thumbsup:
