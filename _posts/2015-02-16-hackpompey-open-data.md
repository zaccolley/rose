On February 7th we once again opened the doors at the innovation space to eager hackers and makers to participate in our second hackpompey event. 

This time, with support from Portsmouth City Council and [Hampshire Hub](http://www.hampshirehub.net/) we decided to try a theme and encouraged the use of Open Data provided through several online API's.

Here's a little of what went on at the second hack event, hackpompey Open Data:

## The Hacks

We were really pleased with the mix of people we had attending our second event, and had a variety of interesting projects as a result:

### Open Pub Golf

Gavin, Tristan and Dan made a way to make a pub golf 'course' using [Open Street Maps](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/). :beer: :golf: by using your postcode as a starting location and the available data on local pubs, it was able to calculate a route between them to use for a pub crawl.

### Spitfire Hardware

Greg came along with part of the inners of his remote control Spitfire he was working on within the [Tangmere Military Aviation Museum](http://www.tangmere-museum.org.uk/). :airplane: 


### Robots!

Cleo and Alex, two GSCE programming students, coded a robot to follow a line and then treated us to a neat animation. :computer:

### Finding Correlations
Dave, Todd and Craig did some digging into the census data and found some interesting crossovers. By using an algorithm called Na√Øve Bayes, they found some correlation in the different parts of the data. :bar_chart:

[Their results were quite interesting...](https://docs.google.com/a/rosedigital.co.uk/presentation/d/1CtytSQlz1olLA-ZNx8FaKJhdEGfSqBOvnA5wIT2uf3c)

### Learning Japanese
Pete started working on a spaced repetition system designed to help students of the Japanese language, currently focusing on learning [Kana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana).

### 3DS Hacking
Dave, after wrestling with the University network, opened up his 3DS. He created some cool homebrewed custom graphics. :video_game:

### Local places
Graham continued to work on his app and with usage of open data he added some local places you may want to visit. :earth_africa:

## Thanks!
