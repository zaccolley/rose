Here's what went on at the second hack event, hackpompey Open Data.

After [the first hackpompey](http://rosedigital.co.uk/blog/2014/11/24/hackpompey.html), we decided to try a theme. We encouraged people to use Open Data in their hacks. One set of open data was from the [Hampshire Hub](http://www.hampshirehub.net/) a place to hold the Hampshire regions data.

## The Hacks

We had a good mix of things people were working on:

### Open Pub Golf

Gavin, Tristan and Dan made a way to make a pub golf 'course' using [Open Street Maps](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/). :beer: :golf:

### Spitfire Hardware

Greg came along with part of the inners of his remote control Spitfire he was working with the [Tangmere Military Aviation Museum](http://www.tangmere-museum.org.uk/). :airplane:


### Robots!

Cleo and Alex, two GSCE programming students, coded a robot to follow a line then treated us to a neat animation. :computer:

### Finding Correlations
Dave, Todd and Craig did some digging into the census data and found some interesting crossovers. By using an algorithm called Na√Øve Bayes, they found some correlation in the different parts of the data. :bar_chart:

[Their results were quite interesting...](https://docs.google.com/a/rosedigital.co.uk/presentation/d/1CtytSQlz1olLA-ZNx8FaKJhdEGfSqBOvnA5wIT2uf3c)

### Learning Japanese
Pete started working on a spaced repetition system for help in learning Japanese, currently focusing on learning [Kana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana).

### 3DS Hacking
Dave, after wrestling with the Uni network, opened up his 3DS. He created some cool homebrewed custom graphics. :video_game:

### Local places
Graham continued to work on his app and with usage of open data he added some local places you may want to visit. :earth_africa:
