We had our first hackpompey hack day on Saturday.

35 people turned out to the [Innovation Space](http://www.innovationspace.org.uk/) for a whole day learning, hacking and meeting new people. :balloon:

Inspired by hack events like [hacksoton](http://hacksoton.com/) and [Pub Hack](http://www.pubhack.co.uk/), we figured out the key to success was making sure people were well fed, WiFi'ed and powered up.

We didn't want it to be competitive and should be open to everyone. So we made it _free_ and encouraged people to work on what they wanted.

## The Hacks

Here's a run down of some of what people were doing. :alien:

### Rubik's Cubes

Solving a Rubik's cube is pretty simple, a lot of people think you need to be a maths genius. :game_die:

[Nick](http://twitter.com/nickcolley) came along with some of his Rubik's cubes and showed people how to solve them and a bit about [speedcubing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing).

### Facial Recognition

Toby was messing about with Open CV and facial recognition. :japanese_ogre:

### ODL Graphics

[Jason](http://twitter.com/creative-element) designed some logos for the [Open Device Lab](http://odl.rose.digital) we're starting up.

He went for a kind of 'science lab' vibe with a flask, and some other device bits and bobs. :iphone: :computer:

### Pebble game

[Max](https://twitter.com/MaxHnt) and [the](https://twitter.com/dcgauld) [Davids](https://twitter.com/dcrichards24) made a game with [Pebble smartwatches](https://getpebble.com/) and [web sockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/WebSockets). :watch: :video_game:

Each watch controls one of the dots on the screen and they have to work together try and collide with each other.

### Population Visualizations

[Gavin](https://twitter.com/GGowenn), [Tristan](https://twitter.com/TristanDavey) and [Alex](https://twitter.com/agpreynolds) wanted to visualise how densely populated places in the world are and compare them.

They came up with a heatmap for people on a global map. :fire: :earth_africa:

Some of their work [is on GitHub](https://github.com/agpreynolds/hackpompey). :link:

### Arduinos

<img class="img-right" src="/assets/hackpompey-arduinos.jpg" alt="Toyeeb, Yasmeen and Peter hacking on arduinos">

Yasmeen, [Peter](https://twitter.com/PeteJDS), Ieva, [Toyeeb](https://twitter.com/ToyeebAfolayan) got cracking with [some Arduinos](http://www.arduino.cc/).

Arduinos are small electronics boards that let you do prototyping with electronics controlled by code.

They made some traffic light systems and even got a speaker playing Merry Christmas. :vertical_traffic_light: :christmas_tree:

### hackpompey Hack Site

[John](https://twitter.com/johnwheal) made a site for the event itself. With all these cool creations it made sense for them to be hosted on [hackpompey.co.uk](http://hackpompey.co.uk). :globe_with_meridians:

### Light Art

[Sean](https://twitter.com/seanmtracey) was messing about with web audio and some cool visuals with his camera. :fireworks: :art:

He got people playing with a light painting program that captured white lights and faded them to create a cool effect.

When shining the light on objects (and people) it 'painted' them into the scene!

### Johnny-Five

[Rob](https://twitter.com/robcalcroft) was playing with [Johnny-Five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five), a node module for interfacing with a Arduino. He made a RESTful interface for some components he had hooked up. :space_invader:

Then he teamed up with Nick to make what will be next instrument something something. :notes:

His code is [over on GitHub](https://github.com/robcalcroft/robofive). :link:

### Snapchat Photo-booth

[Ben](https://twitter.com/benH_arris) and [I](https://twitter.com/zaccolley) worked on a '[Snapchat](snapchat.com/) photo-booth'. :ghost:

Using a camera hooked up to a [Raspberry Pi]() we listened for snaps being sent to the 'hackpompey' Snapchat account. We then took a photo from the camera and sent them back a snap. :movie_camera:

You can [find the code on GitHub](https://github.com/rosedigital/snapcam). :link:

### Browser Capabilities PHP Project

James was working on some open-source code. Improving the [Browser Capabilities PHP Project](https://github.com/asgrim/browscap-php). :package:

### ROSY the Robot

[Jorge](https://twitter.com/jbergasa) and Simon were hacking on their retro robot ROSY. They stayed over after the hack to bring her back to life. :sparkling_heart:

The robot came with a magazine, which included _printed_ BASIC code that you'd use to get it function.

### Cosmic Radiation

[Matthew](https://twitter.com/amattwithers), representing [the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation](http://research.icg.port.ac.uk/), was simulating some cosmic radiation. :star:

### Quadcopter

After cannibalizing another quadcopter, Todd, Richard and David ended up with a quadcopter controlled by their phone's sensors. :helicopter:

The phones sensor data was sent to an Arduino which then interfaced with the quadcopter's remote.

### Show and Tell

If you want to see a terribly edited and shakey cam recording of the show and tell, [I've put exactly that together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMfFKhD6wJw). :video_camera:

### Prizes

We gave away a few goodies at the end: *\*drum roll\**

+ Tristan wasn't so happy to receive a [mythical Dragon fruit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitaya) :pineapple:
+ Yasmeen got a Amazon Giftcard to spend on important hack resources :money_with_wings:
+ [Ejinn](https://twitter.com/EjinnHiew) bagged himself a Raspberry Pi B+ (...shh don't tell him [the A+ is out](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-a-plus/)) :pager:

### Thanks and what's next

Thanks to everyone that came, it was really fun.

Need to thank Andy and the [Innovation Space](http://www.innovationspace.org.uk/) team for the support and for paying for all the great food. :bulb: [Deli Too](https://www.facebook.com/delitoo) sorted out a great lunch for us. :fork_and_knife: :coffee: :cookie: :apple: :lollipop: :pizza:

Also thanks to [Nick Savage](http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-computing/staff/dr-nick-savage.html) and [the School of Computing](http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-computing/) for getting bits and bobs for hacking on.

[Leong](http://instagram.com/leongchye) from the [Photography Society](http://filmandphoto.org/) took some great shots. :camera: You can see some over [on the society's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.617191168408881.1073741891.382441638550503&type=1).

Finally shout out to [Nicola](https://twitter.com/FoxLanguish) and [Mark](https://twitter.com/markbraggins) from the council for coming along. We chatted about themes on the day and we think that's a great idea so that's why the next one will most likely be open data themed.

We'll let you know when that is so follow us at [the](http://twitter.com/hackpompey) [usual](http://instagram.com/hackpompey) [places](http://facebook.com/hackpompey), we're 'hackpompey' everywhere.

Bring on the next one! :thumbsup:
