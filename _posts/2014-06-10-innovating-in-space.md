This week we moved into our new office space, [the Innovation Space](http://www.ris.port.ac.uk/innovationspace/). It's in amongst the University building, in the Halpern House building.

We're on the second floor which is home to different student start-ups, it's an incubator space of sorts and let's different creatives and entrepreneurs work amongst each other. Makes sense really, it's a lot easier to bounce ideas around or collaborate on projects. :cat:

As part of the [Into the Cell Block](http://www.port.ac.uk/uopnews/2014/04/25/into-the-cell-block-creative-and-digital-start-ups/) programme we were planning to move into the planned refurbished prison cell space provided but we were offered this space as that is currently under construction. It's turned out to be possibly be a better place to work as having people around is great.

We've already been helping each other out as there's a good mix of skillsets. Our floor is targeting graduates mainly the office isn't completely full yet, we're expecting it to get pretty rowdy soon. :smile:

The office is pretty new, there's still some final touches going on. We have access to meeting rooms (named the 'ankle', 'leg', 'elbow' and 'head' room haha).
