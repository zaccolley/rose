This week we moved into our new office space, the Innovation Space in the prime of Portsmouth. The building, formally named <a href="#">Halpern House</a> hosts different start-ups on the second floor. It's an incubator space of sorts and allows for creatives and entrepreneurs to work amongst each other.

As our floor is targeting graduates mainly the office isn't completely full yet, we're expecting it to get pretty rowdy soon. :smile:
