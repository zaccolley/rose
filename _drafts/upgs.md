The University of Portsmouth Gaming Society came to us looking for a place to allow their members to find and play games with each other. They often have dedicated servers for their games and they wanted a place to show the availability of the servers and who is online.

<div class="blog-work">
	<h4 class="UPGS">UPGS</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Development &amp; Design - ROSE Digital</li>
	</ul>
</div>

First we worked with their logo, their initial logo used the d-pad and buttons and they wanted us to bring it through to the new revamp. We kept it simple and bold so it would be recognisable in lots of different places, whether that be websites or fresher's fayre stall banners.
