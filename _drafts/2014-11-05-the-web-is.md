Last week we went to [The Web Is](http://theweb.is), a web conference celebrating 25 years of the WWW. 

It's in Cardiff, so Peter and I took the train from Fratton, Portsmouth. 3+ hour journey but no changes so it's not bad. We met [my brother, Nick](http://twitter.com/nickcolley) there. :station:

## Day 0

We arrived and checked in to our hotel. There was a pre-conf meet up at the [Founder's Hub](http://foundershub.co.uk/) for some tabletop games. That was cool we played _Snake Oil_ which was similar to _Cards Against Humanity_ but less horrible. After that we fucked off to a local pub called the [Urban Tap House](http://www.urbantaphouse.co.uk/). :beer:

Turns out it's a place for beer nerds. We don't know a lot about beers so the barkeep ended up pouring shots of different ones while we pretended we could tell difference between them. Met [some](https://twitter.com/FrankJWest) [cool](https://twitter.com/drublic) [cats](https://twitter.com/helloanselm) there.

## Day 1

All the talks were themed by the name of the conference. The web is...

> ### '... knowledge' <cite>[Chris Murphy (@fehler)](https://twitter.com/fehler)</cite>

My brother and I are twins and have both doing web jobs. :sunglasses:

I went to Uni to study whereas he got an apprenticeship at a [local events company **drp**](http://www.drpgroup.com/services/digital). I'm glad I came to University, and I've made the most of the opportunities but I don't think the degree is worth anything on paper.

Chris touched on this and stressed the importance of encouraging people to believe in themselves. He also reaffirmed the very slow pace of the Uni curriculum, often being 5+ years behind industry, yeah...

> ### '... everywhere' <cite>[Anna Debenham (@anna_debenham)](https://twitter.com/anna_debenham)</cite>

Really enjoyed this talk, Anna talked about game console browsers. I think the main question was: Who uses these devices to browse anyway? 

It's a surprising amount and we shouldn't discount a browser or device just because we don't use it. Should always consider the target audience for a product.

... Annnnd this is a good excuse to get some more consoles in [the open device lab](http://odl.rose.digital). :wink:

Anna has [a game console browsers site](http://console.maban.co.uk/) with her findings if you're interested.

> ### '... in the hands of the 97ers' <cite>[Emma Mulqueeny (@hubmum)](https://twitter.com/hubmum)</cite>

"97ers" are people born in 1997 and have always had social media in their lives.

Emma talked about how Instagram, Twitter, <del>Facebook</del> Snapchat etc. are a key part of their identities and should be taken into consideration when designing and building services in the future.

_something about recession/voting?_

> ### '... a discussion' <cite>[Andy Clarke (@Malarkey)](https://twitter.com/Malarkey/) with guests</cite>

Mental health is something that’s affected both Peter and I.

Andy invited Chris Murphy (who spoke the day before), [Cole Henley](http://twitter.com/cole007), [Relly Annett-Baker](http://twitter.com/rellyab) and [Dr. Clare Symons](http://twitter.com/Clare_Symons) to chat about mental health, in and around the industry.

It's good to see it’s being talked about but interesting that Clare noted that it isn’t a industry specific problem. It’s everywhere. 1 in 4 in the UK will experience a mental health issue each year.

She did point out that we can spend a lot of time in isolation so that is a potential problem.

Talking is often easier with people you feel you can relate to, so I think it's important that we have things like this being discussed in groups we're already apart of.

### Evening

Ended up hanging out with some [hackbmth](http://hackbmth.org/) & [hacksoton](http://hacksoton.com/) people talking about [hackpompey](http://hackpompey.co.uk) and the future of the south tech scene...

## Day 2

> ### '... like water' <cite>Scott Jenson</cite>

phsyical wbe devices, url things cool idea.

> ### '... a great big playground' <cite>Seb Lee-Delisle</cite>

Seb is a cool guy, he's cool because he makes art seem accessible to coders. Most of his work is based around code (or lazers), he reminded me of the work that [Kawandeep Virdee](https://twitter.com/whichlight) has been doing in America.

Gave me a good dose of inspiration for some of my pet project

> ### '... still young' <cite>Benjamin Hollway</cite>

young, equality - did a good talk tho

> ### '... turning difficulties into opportunities' <cite>Robin Christopherson</cite>

Last time I saw Robin talk was at [Altitude in Portsmouth](http://altitude.io/), he always gives a great perspective and reinforces thinking about accessibility from the start.

Tabs (Temporarily Able-Bodied haha), need to take this more seriously. It increases usability to everyone not just those with disabilities.

> ### '... taking itself far too seriously' <cite>[Mr Bingo @Mr_Bingo](https://twitter.com/Mr_Bingo)</cite>

How Mr Bingo sees the Internet:

> ### '... progress' <cite>Brad Frost</cite>

open


For me this conf was all about the people, met some really interesting and cool people. Look forward to the next one.
