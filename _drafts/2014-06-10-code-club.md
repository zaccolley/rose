One of our values at ROSE is to encourage diversity and inclusivity in the industry, and we are passionate about contributing to the local tech scene in Portsmouth. Once we found out about Code Club we were excited to find out how we could get involved.

Code club is a series of after school clubs ran by volunteers, that aim to teach children about programming with a series of projects covering websites, games, electronics and more.

Signing up as a volunteer on the Code Club website was easy and there were load of local schools who were excited to invite us in and duscuss our ideas with us. It only took a few days between singning up on the website and having a meeting booked with a school in southsea :]

Stepping foot in a primary school was pretty weird for me, as I haven't been inside a primary school now for 14 years or so. The first thing that jumped out for us was just how low down everything was!
