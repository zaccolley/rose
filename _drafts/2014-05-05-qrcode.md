Here in the Rose office we often find ourselves coming back to one topic in partocular, QR Codes. What are they, do they work and are they needed? This contonuously heated topic encouraged me to write this post.

## The QR Code

A QR Code (Quick Response Code) is a machine readable label which works similarly to the commonly used barcodes you might be familiar with on product packaging. Unlike barcodes; which can store a maximum of 20 digits, QR codes can store up to around 7000 characters including numeric and alphabetic characters, Kanji, Kana, Hiragana, symbols, binary, and control codes.

You might have seen QR Codes dotted around on adverts, product packaging or other peices of media. The use of these codes is attractive to marketers, offering a uniform way for people to interact with their work.  and they appear to be keen on their use, in many instances using them as the only delivery method of the information.

In theory this is a smart and reasonable approach; but what we are finding is that many users do not know what QR codes are or how to scan them. And mobile phone companies are not shipping units with QR Code readers built in making it that much more difficult to access them. Without an accompanying URL these users cannot consume the media at all. 

The QR code originates from Japan, where it is accepted and widely used by the general population. First released in 1994 they were designed as a replacement of barcodes that could store kana and kanji characters as well as numeric ones. It was quickly adopted by the Japanese automotive industry and by 2002 had become a huge trend throughout Japan, ccessible via mobile phones to capture URLs, coupons and other interesting media. 

So why does the QR code work in Japan, and not here?

There are several reasons this could be the case. The different Japanese sylabery, the way they access and consume media , education. DoCoMo, Japans largest mobile network created advertesments which set out to teach the Japanese population about QR codes and how to use them.
